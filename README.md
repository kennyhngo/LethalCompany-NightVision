# ToggleableNightVision

An extension off of [this mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/zilli/NightVision/), adding
configuration to the intensity value and adding keybindings to toggle it on and off.

Now added compatability with the [Diversity](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IntegrityChaos/Diversity/) mod.

## v2.0.0 Update

Night vision now works outside! This also comes with the option to toggle on and off fog to make it easier to see in foggy weather or moons like Rend.  
Once the time gets past around 10:00 PM, it the darkness can overpower the night vision so be cautious when navigating outside without a flashlight. I will be working on this in future updates.  
There was a configuration file rework so you may have to delete the old one and generate a new one for it work properly.
